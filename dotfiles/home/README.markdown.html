<h1>$HOME</h1>
<p>The <code>$HOME</code> directory contains all of my user-specific configurations in the
form of "dot files" - hidden files and directories whose name is prefixed by a
full stop. For ease of browsing this repository, all dot files are missing
their preceeding dot. Should these files be used in your <code>$HOME</code> directory, the
dot must be added back. The installation script in the parent directory will
ensure that all files are named correctly.</p>
<p>As with all other folders, the files within <code>$HOME</code> have been tested only in
Arch Linux.</p>
