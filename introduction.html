    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
    Technically speaking, in computing a "dot file" is a hidden directory or
    file on a UNIX/Linux system that are so named because they are prefixed
    with a full stop. Dot files within a user's home directory contain most of
    the user-specific configuration available on a desktop and are configured
    manually or through the use of tools. 
    </p><p>
    While not all strictly dot files, the files contained here are some of the
    customization I regularly use on my Linux machines as well as on the Linux
    machines of those whom I convert from the lesser operating systems. They
    are offered here with plentiful documentation in the hopes that they will
    be useful to others, whether as an inspiration to explore some different
    areas of Linux, as a shortcut to get a Linux machine up and running, or as
    a guide for users not familiar with how to configure some of these
    applications (like XMonad).

    <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
    <p>
    These configuration files are divided at left by the folders in which they
    are found on a machine to which these have been installed. The subfolders
    may not correspond precisely to system locations, but should serve to
    assist in browsing the tree. For detailed information on where the files
    can be found on your machine, visit the GitHub page for the dot-files by
    clicking the "View on GitHub" link in the upper right.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Clicking on an entry will load the corresponding file in this pane.
    Descriptions are contained at left and source code at right, nicely aligned
    to assist in comprehension. Because the presentation is columnar, you may
    find this window inconvenient for browsing the file due to space
    limitations. The menu at left can be collapsed and expanded by clicking the
    "Toggle Tree Menu" link in the upper right.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
    There are two directories at the top level of the tree: my <code>$HOME</code> folder and
    the <code>/etc</code> directory. <code>/etc</code> contains the system-wide
    configuration files I often install on a new machine or upon daemon or
    application installation. There isn't much in terms of surprise or intrigue
    in these files as they are relatively standard. The magic is in the
    <code>$HOME</code> folder.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>$HOME</code> folder is divided into two top-level folders and a
    file. The file is <a href="#/home/bashrc">.bashrc</a>, the main entry-point
    to user-specific Bash configuration. This file loads the files within the
    <code>.bash</code> directory. These files control aliases, helper
    functions, terminal prompts, executable paths, and much more.
    </p>

    <p>
    The second folder is <code>.xmonad</code> with contains all configuration
    for the <a href="http://www.xmonad.org">xmonad</a> window manager. xmonad is
    a dynamically-tiling window manager for X11 written in Haskell. xmonad is
    very speedy and lightweight because its configuration is also written in
    Haskell and compiled prior to running (it takes only two or three seconds).
    xmonad can also be compiled on-the-fly while its running so you never have
    to leave xmonad to change your configuration.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Bash and xmonad configurations are discussed in more detail below.
    </p>

    <h2>Bash Configuration</h2>
    
    <p>
    Fortunately, Bash configuration is fairly straitforward. On most Linux
    systems, <code>$HOME/.bashrc</code> is the standard configuration file for
    non-login, interactive shells. That is, this configuration is loaded when
    you open a virtual console on one your TTYs or a terminal emulator in your
    desktop environment, but it is not loaded when a script is executed.
    </p>

    <p>
    When exploring my configuration, begin with <a
        href="#/home/bashrc"><code>.bashrc</code></a>. The documentation is
    quite detailed.
    </p>

    <p>
    To use these, simply copy these dot files into your home folder (being sure
    to rename to <code>.bashrc</code> and <code>.bash/</code>) and re-log-in.
    The dot files can be downloaded by clicking the "View on GitHub" link at
    top right and there are more detailed instructions there for installation.
    </p>

    <h2>XMonad Configuration</h2>

    <p>
    xmonad is more difficult to set up than Bash, unfortunately. xmonad is a
    wonderful tiling window manager (my personal favorite) but too many people
    eschew it because the configuration is complicated and, if you're not a
    Haskell wizard, not well documented. I am no Haskell wizard, so my
    configuration is based on many hours of troubleshooting, guess-and-check,
    API documentation browsing, and gleaning what I can from the configurations
    of others. I am sure there are improvements to be made, more efficient ways
    of doing things, and better approaches - but mine works well enough.
    </p>

    <p>
    For a user to run xmonad, she must have a properly-created
    <code>$HOME/.xmonad/xmonad.hs</code> that initializes xmonad and creates a
    basic setup. There is no useful default environment. Once the file is
    created, it must be compiled by running the following command as your user
    - not as root nor with sudo.
    </p>

    <pre>$ xmonad --recompile</pre>

    <p>
    If all is well, the command will exit with no complaints. Otherwise, the
    Haskell compiler (GHC) will provide an error that can be difficult to
    diagnose without being familiar with Haskell. If you run into one of these errors,
    I wish you luck. I fixed mine through trial and error and became familiar
    with Haskell largely through experimenting with xmonad.
    </p>

    <p>
    The compiler outputs an executable binary file in the
    <code>$HOME/.xmonad</code> directory named something like
    <code>xmonad-x86_64-linux</code> that the xmonad command uses to run your
    environment. You will also find several other files in that directory that
    are generated and populated during runtime. We don't need to concern
    ourselves with those here.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <a href="#/home/xmonad/xmonad.hs">xmonad.hs</a> file contains very
    detailed documentation about exactly what it does, so we won't get into
    that here. It does, however, reference the files in
    <code>$HOME/.xmonad/bin</code> so that directory must be copied along with
    <code>xmonad.hs</code> into the <code>$HOME/.xmonad</code> directory. See
    the repository of dot-files on GitHub (link at upper right) for more
    information on installation.
    </p>

    <p>
    For those interested in learning Haskell, there is the wonderful
    interactive and relatively comprehensive and totally free tutorial <a
        href="http://www.learnyouahaskell.com">Learn You a Haskell for Great
        Good</a>. This is not necessary to get started with my configuration
    nor to make basic changes, but if you want to do something fancy or totally
    different, this may help.
    </p>

    <p>
    There is also a large collection of user configurations available <a
        href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Config_archive">here</a>,
    but keep in mind many of these are out of date and will require some
    modifications. They are, however, a great starting point for diving deeper
    than my configuration allows.
