    <h2>Credits</h2>
    <p>
    I've been happy to be a part of the Linux community since the late
    nineties. I have learned so much over the years from the many veterans of
    the various Linux distributions that I could not possibly thank them all
    individually. I must therefore begrudgingly be satisfied presenting the
    community as a whole with my heartfelt appreciation for the accumulation of
    my knowledge and experience.

    <p>
    Due to the number of years I have been maintaining dot files, I have many
    small tricks for many little things that have been written by others for
    which the attribution is long lost. If you notice something here was
    written by you and would like proper attribution, please 
    <a href="http://www.joshdmiller.com/contact">send me an email</a> with your
    name, code license, and a URL to which I can link and I will happily add
    this information to the dot files' documentation posthaste.

    <p>
    That said, some projects were specifically employed in the creation of this
    website for which thanks and a URL would be appropriate. First, this
    website is written in accordance with the HTML5 and CSS3 standards as they
    existed in early 2012; you can read more about these standards at Google's
    wonderful <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com">html5rocks.com</a> and <a
        href="http://css3please.com/">CSS3, Please!</a> and browser
    compabibility at <a href="http://twitter.com/Fyrd">@Fyrd</a>'s <a
        href="http://www.caniuse.com">caniuse.com</a> in addition to the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3C</a>'s <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss">introduction</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In terms of CSS, I cheated a little bit by leveraging 
    <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>'s wonderful little 
    <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap framework</a>. 
    Bootstrap contains a series of pre-defined styles to get a web app or
    simple web page up and running quickly. Other than their reset styles, the
    top navigation bar and large collection of mixins and variables were quite
    helpful. Bootstrap contains many other features I did not employ and I
    encourage developers and designers checking it out.
    </p>
 
    <p>
    I also used <a href="http://www.lesscss.org">Less</a> as a CSS superset.
    Less adds a host of super-useful additions to CSS that make development and
    especially maintenance measureably more manageable like parametric mixins
    and namespaces. I could have used <a href="http://www.sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>
    instead of Less as they offer many of the same features, but Bootstrap 
    makes heavy use of Less and using the same technology made things easier.
    </p>

    <p>
    Effects, asynchronous communication, and hash-based URL routing were
    accomplished with the help of the <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">Dojo
        Toolkit</a>. Dojo is a fantastic javascript library that is well-suited
    for large-scale projects and to a very slightly lesser degree small- and
    medium-scale projects. Version 1.7 is current as of this writing, sporting
    a RequireJS-style AMD loader.
    </p>

    <p>
    I also used <a href="http://www.coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>, a cool
    little language that compiles into conformant, readable JavaScript. I
    have always hated developing with JavaScript, but Dojo and CoffeeScript make
    it almost fun - no joke! - and efficient and straightforward.
    </p>

    <p>
    To generate literate-programming-style documentation from my dot files, I used
    <a href="http://rtomayko.github.com/shocco/">Shocco</a> and <a
        href="http://sourrust.github.com/hyakko/">Hyakko</a>, which are
    respectively Bash and Haskell ports of the wicked-cool <a
        href="http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/">Docco</a> for CoffeeScript.
    (While I did not employ Docco here, Docco can be run against all my
    CoffeeScript files.)
